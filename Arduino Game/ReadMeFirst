This is a "Simon Says" game designed to be played with an 3x3 arduino board. The user receives a pattern on the arduino by a series of lights turning on in sequence. The user must copy the sequence on the replica of the board in the app. If the user enters the correct sequence for the round, they can progress to the next round that includes an additional light in the sequence. If a user enters and incorrect pattern, a certain sequence shows up on the arduino board with sound to let them know they messed up. The user can go on to restart the game. If the user enters the right sequence until the last round, they will win the game.
